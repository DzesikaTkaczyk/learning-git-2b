    	<p>I just want to stay in sun where I find,<br>I know it’s hard sometimes,<br>Pieces of peace in sun’s peace of mind,<br>I know it’s hard sometimes,<br>Yeah I think about the end just way too much,<br>But it’s fun to fantasize,<br>All my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was,<br>But it’s fun to fantasize.</p>
        <p>I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride,<br>I’m falling so I’m taking my time on my ride.<br>Taking my time on my ride</p>
        <p>“I’d die for you,” that’s easy to say,<br>We have a list of people that we would take,<br>A bullet for them, a bullet for you,<br>A bullet for everybody in this room,<br>But I don’t seem to see many bullets coming through,<br>See many bullets coming through,<br>Metaphorically I’m the man,<br>But literally I don’t know what I’d do,<br>“I’d live for you” and that’s hard to do,<br>Even harder to say when you know it’s not true,<br>Even harder to write when you know that tonight,<br>There were people back home who tried talking to you,<br>But then you ignored them still,<br>All these questions they’re for real,<br>Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?<br>And would you ever kill?</p>
